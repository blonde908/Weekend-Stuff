			My Weekend
		</h1>
		<h2>
			Saturday
		</h2>
		<h4>
			On Saturday, I visited my friend, who was about to leave for vacation. We hung out and talked, he's not going to the same high school as me so him leaving is kinda sad. Then I came home and had another friend over and we talked and caught up from the past four weeks. Then I watched Zootopia with my sister. It didn't finish untill 9:30 so I went to my room and wrote a song for my album.

			Sunday
		</h2>
		<h4>
			On Sunday, I woke up late. Then I helped my family with groceries and other things like that. Then my sister dropped me off downtown to hang out with a couple of friends. I haven't seen them since school let out so there was a lot to talk about. We walked around and had a blast. Eventually a few other people came and we had so much fun. We played fun games and ate a lot of food.I came home and my sister was watching a stupid show so I went upstairs, grabbed my guitar and worte 2 songs. I mean they still need work but I think they are okay.
