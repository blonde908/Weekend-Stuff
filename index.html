			Saturday

		<h4>
			On Saturday, I visited my friend who was about to leave for vacation. Then I came home and had another friend over and we talked and caught up from the past four weeks. Then I watched Zootopia with my sister. It didn't finish untill 9:30 so I went to my room and wrote a song for my album.
